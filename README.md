# Welcome to my Automation Portfolio! ðŸš€

This repository showcases my skills in automated testing, focusing on various real-world projects where Iâ€™ve implemented test automation strategies and frameworks using tools like Selenium WebDriver, Playwright, and Robot Framework.

In this portfolio, youâ€™ll find:

Automated Test Scripts: Scripts for functional, regression, and performance testing across different platforms.
Framework Implementations: Custom frameworks built using popular testing libraries (e.g., TestNG, JUnit, Mocha).
Real-World Projects: Testing on different applications, ranging from eCommerce websites to HR management systems.
Test Reports & Logs: Integrated with reporting tools like Allure, ExtentReports, and JUnit to visualize test results.
Iâ€™ve made sure to follow best practices in structuring the code, keeping it clean, modular, and easy to understand, so you can dive in, explore, and even contribute!

Feel free to check out the individual projects, test cases, and reports within each folder. If you have any questions, or if you'd like to collaborate, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. Letâ€™s automate and make testing easier together! ðŸ¤–ðŸ’»
